# Pattern Recognition
NCTU 107 Fall class

## Lab1 - Plot data 
In this Lab we need to 
-    Use Matlab to draw some mathematical function 
-    Implement popular functions, e.g., Gaussian function 
-    Get familiar with MNIST database

## Lab2(a) - Multilayer Perceptron with data in lab1
- In multilayer perceptron model, use gradient descent method to solve the following problems
- **Can not use toolbox**, implement the MLP by ourself

## Lab2(b) - Multilayer Perceptron with MNIST
-    In multilayer perceptron model, use gradient descent method to solve the real data problem in MNIST(http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)
-    **Can not use toolbox**, implement the MLP by ourself
-    The MNIST database of handwritten digits has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples.
